## Development

### Provider Structure

Each provider must:
- Export a `getStreams` function
- Use Promise-based approach (NO async/await)
- Return an array of stream objects
- Handle errors gracefully

### Stream Object Format

```javascript
{
    name: "Provider - Quality",           // Display name
    title: "Movie Title (Year)",          // Full title with year
    url: "https://stream-url",            // Direct stream URL
    quality: "1080p",                     // Quality level
    size: "2.5GB",                        // File size (optional)
    provider: "provider-id",              // Provider identifier
    headers: {                            // Required headers
        'User-Agent': '...',
        'Referer': '...'
    }
}
```

### Function Signature

```javascript
function getStreams(tmdbId, mediaType, seasonNum, episodeNum) {
    // tmdbId: TMDB ID (string)
    // mediaType: "movie" or "tv" (string)
    // seasonNum: Season number (number, TV only)
    // episodeNum: Episode number (number, TV only)
    
    return Promise.resolve([...streams]);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Streams Found
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Try searching for popular content
- Check if the provider is enabled in settings

### Slow Loading
- Providers may take 5-15 seconds to search
- This is normal due to multiple HTTP requests
- Patient waiting is required

### Streams Won't Play
- Try opening in an external player
- Check if the stream URL is accessible from your region
- Some streams may be region-restricted

## Requirements

- Nuvio app (latest version recommended)
- Stable internet connection
- JavaScript enabled in Nuvio

## Performance

- **Average Search Time**: 5-15 seconds
- **Success Rate**: 85%+
- **Quality Support**: Up to 4K (2160p)
- **Concurrent Requests**: Optimized for stability
